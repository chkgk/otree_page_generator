Specification for experimental instructions written in markdown
---

General ideas:
- use a markdown to html parser library like mistletoe?
- process either the resulting HTML or the markdown to gather otree specific data
- we can use the same variable definition as in the word adapter

---

Top level headings define new page and specify the title
Spaces are removed to form the page class name

# Introduction

generates:
class Introduction(Page)
    pass

and fills the {{ title }} tag on the template.

---

blank lines define paragraph beginnings and endings

---

line breaks are transformed into <br> by default

---

**bold** and and *italic* text are formatted as <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i>
